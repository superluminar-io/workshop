# Costs of a superwerker setup

superwerker itself is free and open source under an [MIT licence](https://github.com/superwerker/superwerker/blob/main/LICENSE.md). Costs may be incurred by the AWS services you set up. Smaller set-ups and test set-ups cost less than $10/month.

A goal of superwerker is to provide you with a set of well configured AWS services. These services come with their normal pricing depending on the AWS region you choosepac.

Some AWS services that will be configured by superwerker are:

- [AWS Security Hub](https://aws.amazon.com/security-hub/pricing/)
- [Amazon Route 53](https://aws.amazon.com/route53/pricing/)
- [AWS Config](https://aws.amazon.com/config/pricing/)
- [Amazon S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/pricing/)
- [Amazon GuardDuty](https://aws.amazon.com/guardduty/pricing/)
- [AWS Systems Manager](https://aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/pricing/)

A general rule of thumb is, that the cost for these services will grow with the number of AWS accounts and the number of workloads (EC2 instances, databases, Lambda functions, â€¦) you have.
