# Overview

## Goal Of The Workshop

After finishing this workshop, you will understand the fundamental concepts that are required to set up and maintain a secure multi-account AWS environment.

You will install [superwerker]; an official [AWS Quick Start] solution that automates the deployment of AWS services in the cloud. Superwerker has been developed by [superluminar] and [kreuzwerker] to follow best practices for security and efficiency based on their decades of experience as cloud computing consultants.

## Workshop overview

In this workshop you will install and deploy superwerker via AWS CloudFormation into an existing AWS account. We will then guide you through the decisions and service configurations that [superwerker] performs for you and you will learn why they are in place.

You will also get to experience some typical scenarios related to maintaining larger AWS environments like:

- Managing users and access with Single Sign-On
- Organize AWS accounts within your multi-account AWS environment
- Aggregating, organizing, and prioritizing security alerts
- Managing automated backups for databases
