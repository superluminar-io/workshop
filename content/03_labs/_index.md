# Labs

The following labs showcase common task that needs to be done when working with AWS environments.

The tasks take two different perspectives:

- the **platform owner**, who is responsible for the whole AWS environment
- the **workload owner**, who facillitates the platform to run specific workloads

Even though the labs are aimed at different audiences, some of them build on each other and must therefore be done in a specific order.
