# Costs of a superwerker setup

The installation and usage of [superwerker] is free of charge! The project and all included components are available as open-source and provided using the [MIT licence](https://github.com/superwerker/superwerker/blob/main/LICENSE.md).

> Of course, costs will be incurred by the AWS services [superwerker] sets up. For smaller environments, the monthly costs will be less than $10.

## Included Services

The goal of [superwerker] is to provide you with a set of well-configured AWS services. These services come with their default pricing depending on the AWS region you use:

- [AWS Security Hub](https://aws.amazon.com/security-hub/pricing/)
- [Amazon Route 53](https://aws.amazon.com/route53/pricing/)
- [AWS Config](https://aws.amazon.com/config/pricing/)
- [Amazon S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/pricing/)
- [Amazon GuardDuty](https://aws.amazon.com/guardduty/pricing/)
- [AWS Systems Manager](https://aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/pricing/)

> As a rule of thumb: The costs for these services will grow with the number of AWS accounts and the number of workloads (EC2 instances, databases, Lambda functions, â€¦) you use.

Based on experience from multiple customer engagements, moving from a single AWS account setup to a multi-account setup later, when some applications and teams are already working on AWS, results in a higher investment compared to the monthly cost of starting out with a fresh install of superwerker.
