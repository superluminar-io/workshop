# Introduction

## Goal of the Workshop

In this workshop you will start with installing [superwerker]. The setup process on its own is rather simple, since you only need to deploy a single CloudFormation stack template. The goal of this workshop is to teach you how to facilitate superwerker in achieving your real goal: Maintaining a secure and sustainable AWS environment in a best practice-driven fashion.

You will explore the decisions superwerker makes for you and learn why they are made in the first place.

You will also walk through some typical use case scenarios when it comes to maintaining large AWS Environments like:

- Managing Users and Access
- Restore automatically created backups
- Aggregate, organize, and prioritize security alerts
- Onboarding existing AWS Accounts in your new AWS Environment

## AWS Environments and superwerker

Multi-account environments enable improved security and cost outcomes. They also contribute to key metrics like development and deployment velocity by retaining the technological freedom for small and independent workload teams. Managing a cloud infrastructure consisting of multiple AWS accounts is therefore one of the most important but also complex topics for Well-Architected cloud environments.

[superwerker] helps you with this task by applying best practices from multiple years of cloud consulting. By leveraging superwerker, you will be able to quickly focus on your core business.

## Prerequisites

To install superwerker you will need to fulfil the following two prerequisites:

1. You need a dedicated AWS Account you have administrative access to ([sign up here](https://portal.aws.amazon.com/billing/signup))
2. A Domain, you can manage DNS settings for. You can easily register a new domain with [Amazon Route53](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/domain-register.html).

Now you are good to go and can start installing superwerker.
